Plan for creating the webpage:

general site layout will be:

index.html (homepage)
aboutMe.html
contactMe.html
resources.html

I am going to model this site after https://www.sholltherapygroup.com/... to do so,
I want to experiment with creating the site by making the big sections first, then moving
into the smaller details, such as text and information... The layout should be complete
and the site should look like a put together, yet empty, webpage before the actual text
information is added.
