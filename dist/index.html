                I am a psychotherapist providing individual therapy services to adults and adolescents. 
                Many of those that I work with have experienced deep pain in their lives, and our work 
                together involves exploring that pain and its impact. We'll take time to move at the pace 
                that feels comfortable-this is not a space we need to rush. It's a space to be, to feel, 
                regardless of what that feeling is.
                
                <br>
                <br> 

                My work prioritizes consistency and stability. In order to delve into those difficult 
                emotions and topics in an impactful way, we first need safety to feel comfortable exploring. 
                In the same way that waves wear down rocks, the consistency of the work we do in sessions 
                wears down and loosens the grip of what's restricting you.

                <br>
                <br>

                I've witnessed the beauty of healing, and know it is possible. Stepping into this space uncovers 
                and brings up pain, but it also deepens our connection to ourselves. It allows us to discover all
                 the parts that make us human and gives them the space they deserve.
